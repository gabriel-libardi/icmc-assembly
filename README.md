# Welcome to ICMC assembly language support for VSCode (and VSCodium)
This is a language extension designed to assist students taking the 
[Organization and Architecture of Computers](https://gitlab.com/simoesusp/disciplinas/-/tree/master/SSC0902-ENG_COMP_Organizacao-e-Arquitetura-de-Computadores) course or equivalent at University of São Paulo, São Carlos. It adds support for the RISC assembly language made for the [ICMC-Processor](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC), a complete computer architecture developed by students and researchers at the University to teach the subject.

## Features
